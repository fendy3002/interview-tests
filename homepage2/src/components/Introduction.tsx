        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>
          I've begun working as software developer since 2012. I was starting
          with .Net C#, for around 4 years. Then I change to both PHP with
          Laravel, and finally to NodeJS up to present time. During my time with
          PHP and NodeJS, I also applicate ReactJS and typescript for my work
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my 10 years of working, I've handled many databases, from MS
          SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL to NoSQL with MongoDB. I am also
          experienced at handling decently sized data and indexing, up to tens
          of millions rows of SQL data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've used many programming tools, such as using git as version
          control, containerization with docker, messaging with rabbitmq and
          memory caching with redis. I am also excel at designing database and
          gathering requirements, talking directly to stakeholders, planning and
          proposing the application design.
